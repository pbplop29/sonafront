In the root folder, do:

npm install express axios cors body-parser nodemon nodemailer

And inside "Client" folder, do:

npm install firebase axios react-burger-menu

And to start the server, do:

npm run dev

in the root folder.

Just made a little change to responsiveness and aligned the sidebar menu as a different component which gets called within 
header component.
