Just made a little change to responsiveness and aligned the sidebar menu as a different component which gets called within 
header component.

# Added stuff to gallery page not final yet but arranged a lot better 
# Also added a feature that hides the navbar on scrolling down so that it doesnt obstruct the gallery viewin gexperience
## MOTU in client install this
